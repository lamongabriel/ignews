A subscription service made with NextJS, built for SEO indexation, with GitHub authentication, Stripe for payments and PRISMIC CMS for creating page Docs.

Every page as a preview if the user is not logged in and the user must be an active subscriber to see the whole article. The payment system is made via Stripe, where the user can will be redirected to if an active subscription plan is not detected.

The project also makes use of FaunaDB, so it can handle users login data and plans. Fauna just stores users id and subscription data, if it's active or not.

Made with Stripe you can safely and reliably make payments, store credit-card data, and use 1 click purchase. The service comes with a monthly-subscription payment type, so every month stripes handles the billing.

### Testing the Payment API ðŸ’²

As TEST mode is activated, you can use a fake card to test the payment system without using your real money.

```bash
# Stripe comes with a fake card that you can use.

# Card Number
4242 4242 4242 4242
```

All other info can be random, you can input whatever you want.
